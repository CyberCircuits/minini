#summary description of the FatFs library

= From the FatFs home page =

FatFs is a generic file system module to implement the FAT file system to small embedded systems. The FatFs is written in compliance with ANSI C, therefore it is independent of hardware architecture. It can be incorporated into cheap microcontrollers, such as 8051, PIC, AVR, SH, Z80, H8, ARM and etc..., without any change.
